Web App Design with React Week 3 Coding Assignment

Coding Steps:
1.	Using the Houses API, or any open API of your choice you can find online, create a single page that allows for all 4 crud operations to be performed on a resource from that API. Create a React component (or more, if needed) to represent the resource. Make all forms and other necessary UI pieces their own components as reasonable.
